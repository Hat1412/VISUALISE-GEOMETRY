# VISUALISE-GEOMETRY

Geometry is the study if earth measurements shapes patterns etc This program will help a person to visually understand the wonders of geometry 
This program is made by **Hat1412 from Team Singularity** for the **Timathon** hosted by <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg> [Tech with Tim]</a>

Do download this zip and run the main_screen.py file you will not regret it For best experience use earphones

The plus and minus buttons increases/decreases the width of the brush.
Drawings can only be saved as eps files, Don’t add any extensions when saving.

**POLYGONS:** <br>
Just enter the length of each side with the number if sides and see turtle draw the shape and also give the perimeter and area 
Perimeter = n*l [n = Number of sides, l = Length of sides]
Area = (l2 n)/[4 tan (180/n)]
